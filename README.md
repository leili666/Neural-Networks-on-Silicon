## My Contributions
I'm working on energy-efficient architecture design for deep learning. Some featured works are presented here. Hope my new works will come out soon in the near future.

[Jun. 2018] A retention-aware neural acceleration (RANA) framework has been designed, which strengthens DNN accelerators with refresh-optimized eDRAM to save total system energy. RANA includes three techniques from the training, scheduling, architecture levels respectively.
- [**RANA: Towards Efficient Neural Acceleration with Refresh-Optimized Embedded DRAM.**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8416839/) (**ISCA'18**) 
  - **Training Level**: A retention-aware training method is proposed to improve eDRAM's tolerable retention time with no accuracy loss. Bit-level retention errors are injected during training, so the network' s tolerance to retention failures is improved. A higher tolerable failure rate leads to longer tolerable retention time, so more refresh can be removed.
  - **Scheduling Level**: A system energy consumption model is built in consideration of computing energy, on-chip buffer access energy, refresh energy and off-chip memory access energy. RANA schedules networks in a hybrid computation pattern based on this model. Each layer is assigned with the computation pattern that costs the lowest energy.
  - **Architecture Level**: RANA independently disables refresh to eDRAM banks based on their storing data's lifetime, saving more refresh energy. A programmable eDRAM controller is proposed to enable the above fine-grained refresh controls.

[Apr. 2017] A deep convoultional neural network architecture (DNA) has been designed with 1~2 orders higher energy efficiency over the state-of-the-art works. I'm trying to further improve the architecture for ultra low-power compting. 
- [**Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architecture with Reconfigurable Computation Patterns.**](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7898402/) (**TVLSI popular paper**)
  - This is the first work to assign Input/Output/Weight Reuse to different layers of a CNN, which optimizes system-level energy consumption based on different CONV parameters.
  - A 4-level CONV engine is designed to to support different tiling parameters for higher resource utilization and performance.
  - A layer-based scheduling framework is proposed to optimize both system-level energy efficiency and performance.
